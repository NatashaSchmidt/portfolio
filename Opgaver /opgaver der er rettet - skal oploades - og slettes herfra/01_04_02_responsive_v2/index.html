        <h1>Swiss Design</h1>

        <div class="sectionwrapper">
            <h3>Swiss Design is widely admired for its clean lines, objectivity, and readability. It has enjoyed massive impact on graphic design as a whole, especially with the modernist movement. A study in minimalism, Swiss Design tended to emphasize typography in its works.</h3>
            <div class="column">
                <h2>ABOUT</h2>
                <p>To discover this movement’s roots, we have to travel all the way back to 1896, when the Berlin-based Berthold Type Foundry came out with its Akzidenz Grotesk Typeface in an effort to—you guessed it—represent an objective design style. This event was the spark that led to the evolution of what would eventually be- come the Swiss style: a movement interested in communicating its message clearly and in a way that was universally direct.</p>

                <p>The birth of graphic design as such can be dated to the 19th century, when “arts and crafts” and the “applied arts” first began to dis- tinguish themselves from so-called “fine art” (i.e. painting, sculpture and architecture) and establish independent institutions of study. </p>

                <p>For whatever reason, this movement for the independence of design was strongest in the German speaking world and the English speaking one. For a snapshot of its effects in the early 20th century, we can consider one English movement, the Arts and Crafts, and one German one, the Jugendstil (or “youth style”). Swiss Design was a reaction against both of these.</p>

                    <h4>The Grandfather of Swiss Design</h4>
                    <p>Ernst Keller is in many ways the grandfather of Swiss Design. Ernst Keller was born 1891 in Aarau, Switzerland. Keller was first trained as a draughtsman and lithographer in 1906. He worked in Leipzig, Germany until 1914. Keller joined Zurich’s famous Kunstgewerbeschule (School of Applied Art) in 1918 until he retired in 1956.</p>
                    <p>As a teacher Ernst Keller was the most im- portant single influence on the development of the Swiss style while teach- ing design and typography. He then estab- lished several training programs in design and typography and was called “the father of Swiss graphics”. The economically drawn images and inventive lettering of his posters designed in the 1920s and 30s made an important contribution to Modernism. Keller created a design system characterized by a rigid grid format, structured layout and un- justified type. The core of these ideas were first pre- sented in the book Grid Systems in Graphic Design by his student Josef Muller-Brockmann.</p>
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    <h4>Known For</h4>
                    <p>Keller is famous for his posters for the Kunstgewerbemuseum Zurich, several charity organizations, heraldic logos (like the one for the canton of Glarus) and after his retirement from his work as a sculpture. He died in 1968 in Zurich/Switzerland.</p>

                    <h4>Striking and Rhythmic Compositions</h4>
                    <p>Müller-Brockmann was one of Ernst Keller’s students and also one of the leading protago- nists of Swiss Design in the 1950s.Josef Müller-Brockmann is highly regarded for his posters, which use text, photographs and simple graphics to create striking and rhythmic compositions. He is also well known for his unswerving commitment to grid-based design. Whitch is explained in his own words:
                        <br>
                        “In my designs for posters, advertisements, brochures and exhibitions, subjectivity is suppressed in favour of a geometric grid that determines the arrangement of the type and images. The grid is an organisational system that makes it easier to read the message...
                        The grid is an organisational system that enables you to achieve an orderly result at a minimum cost. The task is solved more easily, faster and better.” </p>
                    <h4>Known For</h4>
                    <p>One of Josef Müller-Brockmann’s most spec- tacular pieces, advertises noise protection whitch involves the head of a woman, who is desperately covering her ears. The headline is aligned in the same direction. Both the image and text form an urgent appeal against ex- cessive noise.
                        His work is best known for its simple designs and clean use of typography. The shapes and colors he incorporated in his work still inspire the graphic designers of current generation. He passed away on August 30, 1996.</p>

                    <p>Armin Hofmann work gives even greater weight to typography and employs striking tonal contrasts. He held a teaching appoint- ment at Yale University in the mid 1950s, and was instrumental in bringing the Swiss Style to the United States.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Setting New Standards</h4>
                    <p>Hoffman’s teaching methods were un- orthodox and broad based, setting new standards that became widely known in design education institutions throughout the world. His independent insights as an educator, married with his rich and inno- vative powers of visual expression, created a body of work enormously varied - books, exhibitions, stage sets, logotypes, symbols, typography, posters, sign systems, and en- vironmental graphics.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Known For</h4>
                    <p>His work is recognized for its reliance on the fundamental elements of graphic form - point, line, and shape - while subtly convey- ing simplicity, complexity, representation, and abstraction.</p>
                    <p>His posters have been widely exhibited
                        as works of art in major galleries, such as the New York Museum of Modern Art. He was also an influential educator, retiring in 1987. In 1965 he wrote the Graphic Design Manual, a popular textbook in the field.</p>

Objective photography is another design element meant to present in- formation clearly, and without any of the per- suading influences of propaganda or commer- cial advertising. Swiss Design has often also been used in relation to concerts, museeums ect. to appear spectacular to the audience.</p>

                    <h3>The Color Palette</h3>
                    <p>Swiss designers realized that the use of bright colors was not always required to create visu- al interest. Using a complementary color pal- ette of muted tones can still draw attention in an oversaturated market. Combined with the other Swiss design elements of minimalism and a sole focal point, a muted array of colors can shine just as brightly as a hot pink or neon green.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="column_narrow">
                <h3>Using Colors</h3>
                <p>Another way traditional Swiss Designers managed to catch the eye was by perfecting their strategic use of color. Using one solid, bright color to make a design pop, or combining unusual colors together, gave the images a way to stand out. The text and the style remained uniform and minimal to let the color speak for itself.</p>
                <p>Using one bright color on something such as a busi- ness card will definitely get you a call back! The bright color would stand out among a stack of bor- ing and plain cards and that will mean you get called before everyone else.</p>
