        <h1>Swiss Design</h1>
        <h3>Swiss Design is widely admired for its clean lines, objectivity, and readability. It has enjoyed massive impact on graphic design as a whole, especially with the modernist movement. A study in minimalism, Swiss Design tended to emphasize typography in its works.</h3>
        
        <section id="om"></section><h2>ABOUT</h2>
        <p>
            To discover this movement’s roots, we have to travel all the way back to 1896, when the Berlin-based Berthold Type Foundry came out with its Akzidenz Grotesk Typeface in an effort to—you guessed it—represent an objective design style. This event was the spark that led to the evolution of what would eventually be- come the Swiss style: a movement interested in communicating its message clearly and in a way that was universally direct.
            The birth of graphic design as such can be dated to the 19th century, when “arts and crafts” and the “applied arts” first began to dis- tinguish themselves from so-called “fine art” (i.e. painting, sculpture and architecture) and establish independent institutions of study.
            For whatever reason, this movement for the independence of design was strongest in the German speaking world and the English speaking one. For a snapshot of its effects in the early 20th century, we can consider one English movement, the Arts and Crafts, and one German one, the Jugendstil (or “youth style”). Swiss Design was a reaction against both of these.</p>

        <h3>Ernst Keller (1891 - 1968)</h3>
        <h4>The Grandfather of Swiss Design</h4>
        <p>Ernst Keller is in many ways the grandfather of Swiss Design. Ernst Keller was born 1891 in Aarau, Switzerland. Keller was first trained as a draughtsman and lithographer in 1906. He worked in Leipzig, Germany until 1914. Keller joined Zurich’s famous Kunstgewerbeschule (School of Applied Art) in 1918 until he retired in 1956.</p>
        <p>As a teacher Ernst Keller was the most im- portant single influence on the development of the Swiss style while teach- ing design and typography. He then estab- lished several training programs in design and
        typography and was called “the
        father of Swiss graphics”. The economically drawn images and inventive lettering of his posters designed in the 1920s and 30s made an important contribution to Modernism.
        Keller created a design system characterized by a
        rigid grid format, structured layout and un- justified
        type. The core of these ideas were first pre- sented
        in the book Grid Systems in Graphic Design by his
        student Josef Muller-Brockmann.</p>

        <br>
        <h4>Known For</h4>
        <p>Keller is famous for his posters for the Kunstgewerbemuseum Zurich, several chari- ty
        organizations, heraldic logos (like the one for the
        canton of Glarus) and after his retirement from his
        work as a sculpture. He died in 1968 in Zurich/Switzerland.</p>

        <h3>Josef Müller-Brockmann (1914 - 1996)</h3>
        <h4>Striking and Rhythmic Compositions</h4>
        <p>Müller-Brockmann was one of Ernst Keller’s students and also one of the leading protago- nists of Swiss Design in the 1950s.Josef Müller-Brockmann is highly regarded for his posters, which use text, photographs and simple graphics to create striking and rhythmic compositions. He is also well known for his unswerving commitment to grid-based design. Whitch is explained in his own words: </p>
            <br><ul>
            “In my designs for posters, advertisements, brochures and exhibitions, subjectivity is suppressed in favour of a geometric grid that determines the arrangement of the type and images. The grid is an organisational system that makes it easier to read the message...
        The grid is an organisational system that enables you to achieve an orderly result at a minimum cost. The task is solved more easily, faster and better.”</ul>

        <br>
        <h4>Known For</h4>
        <p>One of Josef Müller-Brockmann’s most spec- tacular pieces, advertises noise protection whitch involves the head of a woman, who is desperately covering her ears. The headline is aligned in the same direction. Both the image and text form an urgent appeal against ex- cessive noise.
        His work is best known for its simple designs and clean use of typography. The shapes and colors he incorporated in his work still inspire the graphic designers of current generation. He passed away on August 30, 1996.</p>

        <section id="typografi"></section><h2>TYPOGRAPHY</h2>
        <h3>Helvetica</h3>
        <p>For many people, Swiss Design is basically synonymous with Helvetica—the very name of which in fact means “Swiss” —which was de- signed in 1957 and hit the market in 1960.</p>
        <img src="Eksempel_5c50c91d1f957282448c080e6de83989.jpg" width="400" height="600" alt="poster from a concert of The Metroshifter an Coach back in 1998">
        <p><em>A poster from a concert of The Metroshifter an Coach back in 1998 in Swiss Design</em></p>
        <br>
        <p>The importance of Helvetica cannot be un- derestimated; the typeface is endlessly useful for everything from signage (look at the New York City subway, for example) to web pages to logos. But to really understand it, one must understand the greater tradition of Swiss De- sign.</p>

        <br>
        <p>International Typographic Style (Swiss Style) designs begin with a mathematical grid, be- cause a grid is the “most legible and harmoni- ous means for structuring information.</p>

        <br>
        <p>Text is then applied, most often aligned flush left, ragged right. Objective photography is another design element meant to present in- formation clearly, and without any of the per- suading influences of propaganda or commer- cial advertising. Swiss Design has often also been used in relation to concerts, museeums ect. to appear spectacular to the audience.</p>

        <section id="komposition og farver"></section><h2>COMPOSITION AND COLORS</h2>
        <H3>Colors</H3>
        <p>A traditional way Swiss Designers man- aged to catch the eye was by perfecting their strategic use of color. Using one solid, bright color to make a design pop, or combining un- usual colors together, gave the images a way to stand out. The text and the style remained uniform and minimal to let the color speak for itself.
        Using one bright color on something such as a business card will definitely get you a call back! The bright color would stand out among a stack of boring and plain cards and that will mean you get called before everyone else.</p><br>
        <p>Swiss designers realized that the use of bright colors was not always required to create visu- al interest. Using a complementary color pal- ette of muted tones can still draw attention in an oversaturated market. Combined with the other Swiss design elements of minimalism and a sole focal point, a muted array of colors can shine just as brightly as a hot pink or neon green.</p> <br>

        <br>
        <h3>Composition</h3>
        <p>The impact of the times in which Swiss Design arose had a large impact on its characteristics and aesthetic.
        The use of posters to spread messages of nationalism and patriotism in the 1940s led to the use of combining typography with pho- tography or designs by the Swiss designers in the Post-World War II world. These designers took the minimalist rule and applied it to their photographic or graphic design composition as well. They found that taking or designing pictures with only one focal point or with min- imal imagery created a stronger impact on viewers.</p><br>
